<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h02m04s">really like to ask which is when we</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h02m06s">develop an AGI do you think it'll be</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h02m09s">atheist or a theist based on the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h02m11s">evidence well actually uh I would say</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h02m14s">that it would be logical uh you know I</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h02m17s">mean because the main thing is you</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h02m18s">cannot um you cannot build so I mean</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h02m22s">like you cannot build very very</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h02m26s">I would say that any AI That's built</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h02m28s">would be totally logical because humans</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h02m30s">are actually building it so some sort of</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h02m32s">a bias from humans would be in that um</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h02m36s">in that but so obviously uh it'll</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h02m39s">actually if there is a very very</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h02m40s">intelligent form out there which will be</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h02m41s">built I hope that it's totally logical</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h02m50s">the logic part will will actually be</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h29m59s">oh sure so but my question is more that</a>
00:29:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h30m01s">when you see patterns in nature you</a>
00:30:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h30m04s">think that they have to be designed by a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h30m06s">God but if you see patterns in God you</a>
00:30:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h30m09s">don't think they have to be designed</a>
00:30:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h30m10s">like God has a mind which is a pattern</a>
00:30:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h30m12s">God has thoughts he has a nature those</a>
00:30:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h30m14s">are patterns he has intentions those are</a>
00:30:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h30m16s">patterns and so there's just as much</a>
00:30:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h30m19s">patterns in God as there are in nature</a>
00:30:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h30m22s">but you don't think that the patterns in</a>
00:30:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h30m23s">God have to be created by something</a>
00:30:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h30m25s">external to God right you just think he</a>
00:30:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h30m27s">just has the patterns they're just there</a>
00:30:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h30m29s">and so why not just say the same thing</a>
00:30:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h30m32s">about the universe these patterns are</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h30m42s">of the universe it needs a Creator but</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h30m49s">that when I say that uh these patterns</a>
00:30:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h30m51s">have to carry an explanation these</a>
00:30:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h30m53s">patterns have to come out of somewhere</a>
00:30:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuP_BZvbcA#t=00h30m55s">um that is just one of the ways I</a>
