00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h01m26s">anything pretty much yeah so basically</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h01m29s">like I was thinking about chat and while</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h01m31s">I'm enjoying studying the philosophical</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h01m33s">arguments and all these different things</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h01m36s">and seeing where they go I'm not super</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h01m38s">knowledgeable and it's it would be a lie</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h01m40s">to say you know I became a Christian</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h01m42s">because of the colam cosmological</a>

00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h01m45s">definitely not why I became a Christian</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h01m47s">so thinking more towards like why I</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h01m50s">believe it's really like I it really</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h01m53s">Rings true like the whole properly basic</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h01m56s">reformed epistemology type thing as far</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h01m58s">as God goes so I just basically have</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h02m00s">always believed that there was a God and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h02m05s">yet to I mean I see some that I don't</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h02m08s">think work but so it still seems to me</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h02m10s">like overall it could be a reasonable</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h02m12s">belief to believe there is a God and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h02m14s">then as far as Christianity goes it's</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h02m16s">more just the story of the Bible like</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h02m18s">really Rings true and so I mean as far</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h02m21s">as historical evidence I don't think you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM03HTwdso#t=00h02m30s">anything like that but it's more of just</a>
