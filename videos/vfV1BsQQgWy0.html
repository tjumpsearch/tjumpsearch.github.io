<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1BsQQgWy0#t=00h02m33s">nominalism is basically that uh</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1BsQQgWy0#t=00h02m51s">than things that uh actually exist so</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1BsQQgWy0#t=00h02m53s">essential realism believes that there is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1BsQQgWy0#t=00h10m54s">up literally everything and then we're</a>
00:10:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1BsQQgWy0#t=00h10m56s">just different kinds of knots in the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1BsQQgWy0#t=00h11m00s">big string so we are all technically the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1BsQQgWy0#t=00h11m02s">same thing uh that is a possibility or</a>

00:11:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1BsQQgWy0#t=00h11m14s">one of those is</a>
00:11:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1BsQQgWy0#t=00h11m15s">possible okay but what about the things</a>
00:11:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1BsQQgWy0#t=00h11m17s">you know that are privations of energy</a>
00:11:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1BsQQgWy0#t=00h11m20s">like if you grant that there's like you</a>
00:11:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1BsQQgWy0#t=00h11m21s">know like a mile of like empty space you</a>
00:11:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1BsQQgWy0#t=00h11m24s">know even though still energy it's like</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1BsQQgWy0#t=00h11m26s">it still energy like space is energy yep</a>
00:11:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1BsQQgWy0#t=00h11m29s">still a field so all the different</a>
00:11:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1BsQQgWy0#t=00h11m30s">fields are all different versions of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1BsQQgWy0#t=00h11m35s">you have something that where there is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1BsQQgWy0#t=00h11m39s">of like you know vacuum of existence</a>
00:11:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1BsQQgWy0#t=00h11m41s">okay so so both of the hypotheses are</a>
00:11:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1BsQQgWy0#t=00h11m44s">one is that everything including space</a>
