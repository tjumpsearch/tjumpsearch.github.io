<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2ifCEkB0ig#t=02h54m02s">actually the answer is</a>
02:54:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2ifCEkB0ig#t=02h54m04s">no so if it were possible then there</a>

02:54:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2ifCEkB0ig#t=02h54m10s">is it that distinguishes the two cases</a>

02:54:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2ifCEkB0ig#t=02h54m21s">right so so that apply to your previous</a>
02:54:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2ifCEkB0ig#t=02h54m23s">statement so I write down six rules it's</a>
02:54:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2ifCEkB0ig#t=02h54m25s">not possible for me to even be following</a>

02:54:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2ifCEkB0ig#t=02h54m31s">yes so there's two stages the first</a>
02:54:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2ifCEkB0ig#t=02h54m33s">stage is there you don't know which one</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2ifCEkB0ig#t=02h54m36s">you're doing because there's no facts</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2ifCEkB0ig#t=02h54m42s">there are no facts which tell you which</a>

02:54:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2ifCEkB0ig#t=02h54m53s">even so there is a fact about which one</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2ifCEkB0ig#t=04h23m54s">reasons uh but uh you know that just</a>
04:23:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2ifCEkB0ig#t=04h23m58s">means maybe in reality there's some like</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2ifCEkB0ig#t=04h24m40s">then we that's an abstract mathematical</a>
