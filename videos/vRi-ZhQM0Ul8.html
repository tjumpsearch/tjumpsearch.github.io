<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h02m17s">so one of the arguments I'm going to use</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h02m18s">today is known as um aquinus is first</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h02m21s">way it can be traced back to Aristotle</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h02m24s">um it's basically an argument from</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h02m26s">change so it argues from change to the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h02m31s">unique about this argument is that it</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h02m32s">doesn't assume the beginning of a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h02m34s">universe in fact it actually assumes</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h02m36s">that it's Eternal so um that so from</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h02m40s">there this it makes it a little distinct</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h02m42s">from all the other arguments like colam</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h02m43s">cosmologic argument and that I really</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h02m45s">like it for this reason um so let me</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h02m48s">just go ahead and present the a more</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h02m50s">little bit modernized formulation of the</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h02m52s">argument so I'll be presenting each</a>
00:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h02m53s">premise to its conclusion and then I'll</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h02m56s">be defending each one of those premises</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h02m58s">all right so the first premise in the</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h03m00s">argument from change is that some things</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h03m04s">change that's premise one and now the</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h03m07s">second premise is everything that is</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h03m09s">changing is being changed by something</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h03m12s">else nothing can change itself and the</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h03m15s">third premise is that but this series of</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h03m17s">changes cannot go on to infinity and</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h03m20s">then the conclusion therefore there must</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h03m22s">be a first cause of all change and so I</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h03m26s">would like to start then with the first</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h03m28s">premise um so things change now I think</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-ZhQM0Ul8#t=00h03m31s">this is pretty self-evident I'm moving</a>
