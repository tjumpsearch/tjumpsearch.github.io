<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXcY7LuZaEI#t=03h26m43s">what's your understanding of logic your</a>
03:26:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXcY7LuZaEI#t=03h26m45s">your definition of logic it's a formal</a>

03:27:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXcY7LuZaEI#t=03h27m02s">that then is is logic uh is reasoning</a>
03:27:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXcY7LuZaEI#t=03h27m06s">itself is it required for logic to exist</a>
