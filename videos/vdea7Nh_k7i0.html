<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=00h37m41s">off there's an exception rule in there</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=00h37m52s">reason is there prefer one over the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=00h37m58s">that so let's say there's a calculator</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h01m10s">internal functioning does its internal</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h01m20s">that's following this rule so that would</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h01m33s">so I I can say you designed the lock</a>
02:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h01m36s">plus the breaking to function in this</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h01m38s">way happy to grant that is the lock</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h01m44s">breaking is following the rule um and so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h01m48s">either way it still seems like we can</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h01m49s">look at the system and look at the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h01m54s">looked at the program the question is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h01m56s">what the word is it breaking down is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h02m04s">without knowing how I designed</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h02m07s">it well again I would say breaking down</a>
02:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h02m09s">is whether it loses control over</a>

02:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h02m47s">because I built it that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h26m28s">smart person can make a program being</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h26m32s">implemented by doing something that you</a>
02:26:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h26m34s">would think of as breaking</a>
02:26:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h26m39s">down so that you say the system is</a>
02:26:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h26m42s">broken but it's actually doing what it's</a>
02:26:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h26m44s">supposed to be doing it's not</a>
02:26:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h26m47s">broken all right well we've been going</a>
02:26:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h26m48s">for about two and a half hours and I</a>
02:26:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h26m49s">have to get the to work pretty soon</a>
02:26:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h26m54s">okay I</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h26m57s">don't I don't think my position has</a>
02:26:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h26m59s">changed I still don't understand that</a>
02:26:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h27m02s">part of the argument still for me it's</a>
02:27:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h27m04s">like if we look at the physical system</a>
02:27:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h27m06s">we know it's rules following whether or</a>
02:27:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h27m07s">not it's programmed in or</a>
02:27:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h27m09s">not and the breaking I would I would</a>
02:27:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h27m11s">count that as an externality just on how</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h27m24s">answer to the challenge which is what is</a>
02:27:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dea7Nh_k7i0#t=02h27m26s">it about the physical system that proves</a>
