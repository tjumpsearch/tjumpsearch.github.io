<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc1jVfS1478#t=00h59m47s">so you're saying that space time emerge</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc1jVfS1478#t=01h00m13s">like particles are a kind of fluctuation</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc1jVfS1478#t=01h00m17s">um so field and fluctuations in fields</a>
01:00:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc1jVfS1478#t=01h00m19s">are two different things</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc1jVfS1478#t=01h00m28s">they can form particles and those</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc1jVfS1478#t=01h00m33s">that uh there are there's evidence of it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc1jVfS1478#t=01h00m36s">in the models which is again more than</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc1jVfS1478#t=01h22m52s">um you have a theory and your theory is</a>
