<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h04m59s">um and like we'll probably see in the</a>
00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h05m01s">discussion here there's various reasons</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h05m02s">for that but I'll sort of just tell you</a>
00:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h05m05s">like hey here's why</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h05m06s">I think there is god</a>
00:05:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h05m09s">um right in putting it in the kind of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h05m12s">terms that I think uh a neoplaton has</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h05m14s">put it in so uh the basic reason uh is</a>
00:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h05m18s">because</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h05m20s">um what I what I use the term God to</a>

00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h05m30s">be I use the term God to name the reason</a>
00:05:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h05m33s">why reality is the way that it is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h05m36s">and so since that's what I call God and</a>
00:05:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h05m38s">I think there is a reason why reality is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h05m53s">you know we could have a discussion</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h05m54s">about what exactly is that reason why</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h05m56s">what else can we say about it but that's</a>
00:05:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h05m59s">essentially what God's existence just as</a>

00:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h06m03s">um means in the neoplatonic context so</a>
00:06:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h06m06s">just to clarify</a>
00:06:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h06m08s">um that would seem to entail that God</a>

00:06:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h06m18s">in Plato's Republic where Plato says the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h06m25s">say yeah God is beyond being and so</a>
00:06:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h06m27s">really when we say God exists like in a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h06m30s">way yes God exists and another way we</a>
00:06:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h06m31s">have to say God doesn't exist because</a>

00:06:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h06m47s">because I Define reality as all things</a>

00:15:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h15m27s">fundamental nature of reality makes</a>

00:15:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h15m31s">reality or explains reality or uh is the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h15m35s">reason why reality is the way that it is</a>
00:15:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h15m37s">well that seems to be like now it's not</a>
00:15:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h15m39s">just the fundamental nature of reality</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h15m41s">it's that plus something that doesn't</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h15m43s">exist and so it seems like uh there's</a>
00:15:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h15m46s">two separate claims being made there one</a>
00:15:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h15m48s">is that there's a fundamental nature of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h15m49s">reality which I agree with that part I</a>
00:15:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h15m51s">can get on board with but then there's</a>
00:15:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h15m53s">this other claim that is beyond reality</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h15m55s">in that part I don't think makes sense</a>
00:15:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h15m57s">and so I think that if we're comparing</a>
00:15:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h15m59s">World Views essentially why would it be</a>
00:15:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h16m02s">more rational to say that the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h16m03s">fundamental nature of reality is outside</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h16m08s">um and that there must be this</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h16m24s">yeah okay good so so so you mentioned</a>
00:16:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h16m27s">like we're comparing World Views and I</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h16m29s">don't know if I would characterize it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h16m30s">yeah I don't think the neoplayness would</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h16m35s">back to that later because I think your</a>
00:16:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h16m37s">basic question here is why are we</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h16m42s">like crazy</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h16m44s">um and yeah like I think that's a fair</a>
00:16:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h16m46s">question to raise and so like let's try</a>
00:16:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h16m48s">to tackle that first so</a>
00:16:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h16m50s">so this is where you're getting kind of</a>
00:16:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h16m52s">the platonism of it right where the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h16m59s">with the thing so if you and I have</a>
00:16:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h17m01s">human nature well human nature isn't you</a>
00:17:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h17m04s">just you right it isn't just me it isn't</a>
00:17:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h17m06s">just any human actually uh it's</a>

00:17:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h17m13s">can understand it still or someone could</a>

00:17:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h17m19s">that sense like human nature is meaning</a>
00:17:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h17m22s">is intelligible independent of any</a>

00:17:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h17m31s">right we can still understand what they</a>
00:17:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h17m33s">were and so it's anything we can</a>
00:17:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h17m35s">understand is or exists in some sense</a>
00:17:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h17m38s">um yeah that's the idea of like if we're</a>
00:17:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h17m41s">going to have a nature and nature exists</a>
00:17:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h17m43s">but it doesn't exist in the same sense</a>
00:17:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h17m44s">that the particular things that have</a>
00:17:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h17m47s">that nature exist</a>
00:17:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h17m49s">um and so if we're talking about reality</a>
00:17:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h17m52s">reality has got to be one thing and it</a>
00:17:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h17m55s">has its nature it has the nature of</a>

00:17:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h17m59s">um but the nature of  isn't</a>
00:17:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h18m02s">reality right they just aren't the same</a>
00:18:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h18m03s">thing they don't exist in the same way</a>
00:18:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h18m05s">uh reality is a particular thing in a</a>
00:18:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h18m08s">sense uh where the nature of reality is</a>
00:18:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h18m10s">not it's in nature and so so yeah this</a>
00:18:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h18m14s">just comes from just the name</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h18m22s">different sense than reality itself is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h18m33s">so the claim would be something like if</a>
00:18:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h18m35s">you grant that there are these</a>

00:43:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h43m54s">you call it physical because it's you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h43m55s">can study it by physics is that sort of</a>
00:43:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h43m57s">how it's getting that name or</a>
00:43:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h43m59s">um made of energy made of matter and</a>
00:43:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h44m04s">but then wouldn't the matter  be</a>
00:44:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h44m06s">the fundamental thing not the field like</a>
00:44:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h44m08s">which is fundamental the field or the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h44m12s">uh well I think so energy is obviously</a>
00:44:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h44m16s">what makes everything energy is just a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h44m19s">with and so in that way I guess energy</a>
00:44:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h44m22s">you know because I think Quantum fields</a>
00:44:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h44m24s">and energy are synonymous in this case</a>
00:44:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h44m25s">so they're not made of anything other</a>
00:44:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h44m27s">than themselves they are themselves</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h44m30s">okay yeah so it's a so</a>
00:44:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h44m33s">so yeah I don't know why we're calling</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=00h44m35s">it physical other than because we can</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=01h05m47s">that then as well so neurons aren't real</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=01h05m50s">so like it seems like the position is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=01h06m08s">well like neurons are a physical thing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=01h34m51s">is because again the answer to that is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=01h35m17s">guess I would say Schrödinger's uh</a>

01:35:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=01h35m26s">would that be an example</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=01h35m35s">make intelligible what true Randomness</a>
01:35:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpOqaMGqUo#t=01h35m37s">means and that is the answer then it's</a>
