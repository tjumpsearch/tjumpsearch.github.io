<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYx7ZatLv-o#t=00h01m55s">that for a purpose and we recognize that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYx7ZatLv-o#t=00h01m58s">uh when we hear</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYx7ZatLv-o#t=00h02m03s">we hear purposeful sounds then we infer</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYx7ZatLv-o#t=00h02m13s">um yeah the uh one facet of rationality</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYx7ZatLv-o#t=00h02m17s">is our ability to know that other Minds</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYx7ZatLv-o#t=00h02m28s">through their actions so it's through a</a>
