<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAJC15PvNJE#t=00h02m35s">infinity can equal anything so he had</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAJC15PvNJE#t=00h02m37s">this proof that it equals zero and then</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAJC15PvNJE#t=00h02m40s">he had the proof that it equals three so</a>
