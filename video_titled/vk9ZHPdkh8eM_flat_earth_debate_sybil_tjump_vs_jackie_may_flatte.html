<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9ZHPdkh8eM#t=00h08m31s">said 240 000 miles away yeah it's about</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9ZHPdkh8eM#t=00h09m11s">so we're measuring its speed revolving</a>
00:09:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9ZHPdkh8eM#t=00h09m14s">around the Earth</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9ZHPdkh8eM#t=00h09m18s">because it's not as it's much bigger so</a>
00:09:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9ZHPdkh8eM#t=00h09m21s">it's not affected by the gravity in the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9ZHPdkh8eM#t=00h09m22s">same way smaller objects can go faster</a>
00:09:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9ZHPdkh8eM#t=00h09m24s">and closer to the center of mass yes</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9ZHPdkh8eM#t=00h09m29s">so smaller objects go faster but the sun</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9ZHPdkh8eM#t=00h09m36s">UH 60 000 times faster than the Earth</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9ZHPdkh8eM#t=00h09m47s">speed is measured by your frame of</a>
