<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h03m28s">obviously then then the discussion goes</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h03m30s">in different directions that's why I</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h03m34s">much more um it's much more focused on</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h03m43s">other thing that I want to clarify is</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h03m44s">the fact that there are two discussions</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h03m46s">here one is the discussion of the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h03m51s">whether or not that Creator sent a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h03m57s">his and so I think today we're going to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h03m59s">be focusing mostly on whether or not</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h04m03s">um uh unless you want to discuss both</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h04m05s">what were you thinking I was just going</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h04m17s">um I guess I'll start with just a simple</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h04m19s">thing so obviously we can go into much</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h06m07s">so our universe definitely has a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h29m18s">a little bit about quantum mechanics at</a>
00:29:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h29m19s">all</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h29m20s">a little bit Yeah so in quantum</a>
00:29:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h29m22s">mechanics there are particles that come</a>
00:29:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h29m23s">into existence they're called virtual</a>
00:29:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h29m24s">particles they just pop into existence</a>
00:29:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h29m25s">no one created them they're just a part</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h29m27s">of the universe they pop in and then</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h29m28s">they destroy each other and they pop out</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h29m29s">so I'm saying that the entire universe</a>
00:29:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h29m31s">can be essentially the same thing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h29m36s">to have this uh Quantum state which can</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h29m39s">cause things to pop in and out of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h29m43s">so it doesn't actually need a Creator it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zD2jfmv7r0#t=00h29m45s">can just be a processed like a Quantum</a>
