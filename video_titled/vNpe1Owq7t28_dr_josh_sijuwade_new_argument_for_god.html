<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h02m21s">of study um so this idea of</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h02m23s">fundamentality in this idea of grounding</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h02m26s">um and so just yeah the snapshot idea is</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h02m29s">that there is a l structure of reality</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h02m31s">uh where reality is not at a flat level</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h02m33s">where everything's existing at the same</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h02m35s">level but reality is hierarchically</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h02m37s">structured in that the less fundamental</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h02m40s">are structured and they are grounded by</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h02m43s">more fundamental things so they're sort</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h02m44s">of a layered view of reality um and</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h02m47s">things fit within those levels of that</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h02m49s">layer structure and so yeah so the idea</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h02m53s">here was was trying to account for um</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h02m55s">firstly the non-fundamental entities</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h02m57s">that are within each of the levels and</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h03m00s">then also the relation that connects</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h03m01s">them together so the relation of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h03m03s">grounding and so I was trying to say</a>
00:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h03m05s">that given a certain abductive criteria</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h03m08s">or inductive criteria um we can sort of</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h03m12s">reason I believe to God being the best</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h03m20s">and also for the relational grounding so</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h03m22s">metaphysicians I believe are are doing a</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npe1Owq7t28#t=00h03m25s">bit of a disservice where where they're</a>
